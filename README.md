# DataStructure_project
This project was completed as part of the Algorithms and Principles of Computer Science course at Politecnico di Milano, taught by Professor [Alessandro Barenghi](https://barenghi.faculty.polimi.it/doku.php). It is an application of the concepts learned about data structures through the C programming language; the performance of the code in terms of space and time allowed me to achieve a grade of 30/30.

The chosen approach is heavily based on the use of Hash Tables; for further information, please refer to the specification file.
